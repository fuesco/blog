Three major steps in traditional software development:

- Design
- Coding
- Testing & Debugging

How to define our classes:

1. **Responsibilities**:

Divide the work into different actors, each with a different job to complete.

2. **Independence**:

Define the work for each class to be independent from other classes as much as possible. Subdivide responsibilities between classes so that each class has autonomy over some aspect of the program.

3. **Behaviors**:

Define the behaviors for each class carefully and precisely, so that the consequences of each action performance is well understood by other classes.

A common tool for development of a high-level design for a project is use of **CRC cards**. Class-Responsibility-Collaborator (CRC) cards are simple index cards that subdivide the work required of a program.
