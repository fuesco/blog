## Cheat Sheet

- Domain Name System (DNS)
- Internet service that converts domain names and routes them into IP addresses.
- **IPv4**: internet protocol version 4 - 32 bit address space (limited number of addresses)
- **IPv6**: internet protocol version 6 - 128 bit address space (unlimited number of addresses)
- **Top-Level Domain**: example**.com** (last part of the domain)
- **Second-Level Domain**: example**.CO**.UK (second last part of domain)
- **Domain Registrar**: 3rd party company who you register domains through.
- **Name Server**: the server(s) which contain the DNS records for a domain.
- **Start of Authority (SOA)**: contains information about the DNS zone and associated DNS records.
- **A Record**: DNS record which directly converts a domain name to an IP address.
- **CNAME Record**: DNS record which lets you convert a domain name into another domain name.
- **Time to Live (TTL)**: time that a DNS record will be cached for. (lower time means changes propagate faster)
