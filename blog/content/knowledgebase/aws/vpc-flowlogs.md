- **VPC Flow Logs** monitor the in-and-out traffic of your Network Interfaces within your VPC.

- You can turn on Flow Logs at the VPC, Subnet, or Network Interface level.

- VPC Flow Logs **cannot be tagged** like other AWS services.

- You **cannot change configuration** of a flow log **after creation**.

- You **cannot enable** flow logs for VPCs which are peered with you VPC unless it is in the same account.

- VPC Flow Logs can be delivered to an S3 Bucket or CloudWatch Logs.

- VPC Flow Logs contains the source and destination IP addresses (not hostnames).

- Some instance traffic is **not monitored**:
  - Instance traffic generated by contacting the AWS DNS servers.
  - Windows license activation traffic from instances.
  - Traffic to and from the instance metadata address.
  - DHCP traffic.
  - Any traffic to the reserved IP of the default VPC router.
