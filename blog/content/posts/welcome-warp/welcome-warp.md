> Warp Â© 2020

Warp was created in order to share my experiences in learning new web technologies. My name is Naval Monga and I have a Bachelors in Computer Science from the University of Maryland. My first few posts will cover introudctions to Python, Flask, and setting up a complete full stack app using both.
